# Placeholder for favicon.ico
# This should be a 32x32 pixel ICO file of your app icon
# Used as the browser tab icon and bookmark icon
#
# To create this file:
# 1. Design your app icon (square format, simple design works best at small sizes)
# 2. Convert to ICO format at 32x32 pixels (or include multiple sizes: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48)
# 3. Replace this text file with your actual favicon.ico
