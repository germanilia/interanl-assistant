## Concept and Background

The GenAI ChatOps Platform is designed to revolutionize how organizations handle internal support, knowledge sharing, and operational tasks through AI-powered conversational interfaces. By leveraging large language models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and domain-specific knowledge bases, the platform aims to provide accurate, contextual responses to user queries while maintaining proper governance, observability, and escalation paths.

Traditional support systems often suffer from:
- Knowledge silos across different teams and tools
- Inconsistent responses to similar queries
- Lack of structured data gathering before troubleshooting
- Limited visibility into common issues and resolution patterns
- Manual escalation processes that delay resolution

The GenAI ChatOps Platform addresses these challenges by creating a unified interface that:
1. Enforces structured data gathering based on domain requirements
2. Retrieves information from approved knowledge sources
3. Provides actionable responses with proper attribution
4. Offers clear escalation paths when automated resolution isn't possible
5. Collects metrics and feedback to continuously improve the system

## Goals and Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Reduce Support Burden**: Automate responses to common queries to free up human experts for complex issues
2. **Improve Response Quality**: Ensure consistent, accurate answers based on approved knowledge sources
3. **Accelerate Resolution Time**: Provide immediate responses when possible and streamline escalation when necessary
4. **Enhance Knowledge Sharing**: Make organizational knowledge more accessible and actionable
5. **Generate Actionable Insights**: Identify knowledge gaps, common issues, and improvement opportunities

### Key Objectives
1. Create a domain-aware system that understands organizational context
2. Implement structured query flows to gather necessary information upfront
3. Develop a robust RAG system that prioritizes knowledge base answers
4. Build comprehensive observability to measure effectiveness and identify gaps
5. Establish clear feedback loops for continuous improvement
6. Maintain proper access controls and permissions for sensitive information

## Core Components

### Knowledge Base and RAG

The Knowledge Base and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system forms the foundation of the platform's ability to provide accurate, contextual responses:

**Key Features:**
- **Multi-source integration**: Connect to various knowledge repositories (documentation, wikis, code repositories, etc.)
- **Permission-aware indexing**: Respect access controls when indexing and retrieving content
- **Source attribution**: Clearly indicate which sources were used to generate responses
- **Quality ranking**: Prioritize high-quality, verified sources over less reliable ones
- **Feedback incorporation**: Continuously improve retrieval based on user feedback

The RAG system follows a structured approach:
1. **Query understanding**: Parse and understand the user's intent and context
2. **Relevant retrieval**: Fetch the most relevant information from knowledge sources
3. **Contextual generation**: Generate responses that incorporate retrieved knowledge
4. **Source attribution**: Provide clear references to the sources used

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) extends the platform's capabilities by allowing it to interact with external systems and data sources:

**Key Features:**
- **Tool integration**: Connect to operational tools and systems
- **Dynamic data retrieval**: Fetch real-time data from logs, monitoring systems, etc.
- **Action execution**: Perform approved actions in connected systems
- **Context enrichment**: Add relevant context from operational systems to improve responses

MCP enables the platform to:
1. Access real-time system data when answering queries
2. Provide context-aware responses based on the current state of systems
3. Execute simple operational tasks when authorized
4. Bridge the gap between knowledge and action

### Agent System

The Agent System orchestrates the interaction between users, knowledge sources, and connected systems:

**Key Features:**
- **Structured query flow**: Guide users through providing necessary information
- **Domain-specific handling**: Adapt behavior based on the domain context
- **Permission management**: Respect user roles and permissions
- **Escalation management**: Identify when to escalate to human support
- **Feedback collection**: Gather and process user feedback

The Agent follows a defined workflow:
1. **Domain identification**: Determine the relevant domain for the query
2. **Information gathering**: Collect required information based on domain requirements
3. **Knowledge retrieval**: Search for relevant information in the knowledge base
4. **Response generation**: Create a helpful, accurate response
5. **Escalation (if needed)**: Route to appropriate human support when necessary
6. **Feedback collection**: Gather user feedback on the response quality

## Requirements by Milestone

### Milestone 1

- **P1**: Allow domain-specific data gathering - user has to first supply all the data defined by domain owners
- **P1**: Enforce a structure on queries
- **P1**: Answer from knowledge base first
- **P1**: Basic metrics (statsD style - "today we got 100 questions")
- **P1**: The bot will list all the sources it used when answering
- **P1**: Provide an escalation path
  - Tag channels' on-call

### Milestone 2

**Feedback Loop and Expanded Connectivity**
- **P1**: Feedback loop on agent answer (like/dislike + free text)
- **P1**: Easily connect to more data sources
- **P2**: Allow connecting MCPs, so the bot can, for example, read logs
- **P1**: Define KPIs
- **P1**: Agent rate limit: Implement agent rate limit mechanism to prevent attacks, user misuse etc.

### Milestone 3
